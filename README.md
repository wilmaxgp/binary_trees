# Binary Trees

This repository contains C code for basic operations on binary trees.

## Description

Binary trees are hierarchical data structures widely used in computer science. This repository provides simple C functions to perform operations like finding depth, size, leaves, nodes, balance factor, and checking if a tree is full, perfect, or balanced.

## Functions

- `binary_tree_depth`: Measures the depth of a node.
- `binary_tree_size`: Measures the size of a tree.
- `binary_tree_leaves`: Counts the leaves in a tree.
- `binary_tree_nodes`: Counts the nodes with at least one child.
- `binary_tree_balance`: Measures the balance factor of a tree.
- `binary_tree_is_full`: Checks if a tree is full.
- `binary_tree_is_perfect`: Checks if a tree is perfect.
- `binary_tree_sibling`: Finds the sibling of a node.
- `binary_tree_uncle`: Finds the uncle of a node.



## Usage

Include the `binary_trees.h` header file in your C program and compile it with the necessary source files from this repository.
